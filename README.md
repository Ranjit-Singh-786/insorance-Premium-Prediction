# insorance-Premium-Prediction
i build a end to end CI/CD pipeline for this project. code written in modular fashion.

## steps to Run this project
1. install all the dependencies
2. run the train.py file
3. run the main.py

## to install dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt

## while run the train.py file
it will execute entire training pipeline and model will get trained.
and entire pipeline will be executed, if you will execute the train.py file.

## while run the main.py
while you will execute the main.py it will execute the batch_prediction function
and prediction will be stored in the prediction directory with timestamp.csv,


## Keep points
1. if you will run the main.py file then it will run the batch_prediction Function.
   But when you will run the train.py file, then it will execute the training pipeline.

2. i added new functionality in the batch_predicter function,
   there is one parameter inside the batch_predicter function, which is database,
   if you will set database = True, then it will take data from mongodb. if you will
   set database = False, then it will take the data for the batch_prediction from
   the current working directory.
