#  --------->  Detailed project Report     <-----
1. dump the data into mongodb database
2. create the project structure by the template.py file script

#main.py
this file will responsible to collaborate all the files. there is some code are comment out.
because we have testing some features of this project. and after testing successfully. i comment out those code.
if you want test again you can execute all those code which i have comment out.

#SETUP.PY
1 -e .   <-- this will indicate setup.py file. and "-e" means editable mode and "." means current working directory.
2. find_packages()   <-- this will fetch all the package from your project.
		in which "__init__py" file is existed. which will be considered as a package of this project.
3.pip install -r requirements.txt   <-- to install all dependency, and when you will install dependencies.
		this file will indicate the setup.py file, bcz there is "-e ." indicator is mentioned.
		after install the dependencies. one extra directory will initialized with in your current working directory
		" insurance.egg-info " it has other all files which will contain the metadata of our project. and it will be ignore by git by defualt. 
required libraries in this file  -->  setup from setuptools and typing

4. don,t execute the setup.py file because it will autometically indicate by "-e ." from requirements.txt

#logger

1. importing method of logger file is different because it is written in __init__.py file.

#Exception

1. writt a static function to get clear cut idea of error.
2. call the function inside the constructur.
3. made a subchild class of Exception.

# _pycache_/__init__.cpython-310.pvc

both files are cache files which will be created by defualt. when we will import some code from
the someone file. then it will create by defualt this _pycache_ file.
so don,t confuse this file. it is unwanted file. which will create by default by the system.
and it will  contain metadata of the file

# .env
in this file we will define all the custome Environment variable. so that 
we can easily access all those variable. very easily.
and by this file we will get some flexibility for our variable. for e.g if we will have need any
path which will be frequently can be change in future. so without going in the code we will difine this
path in the .env file. because if we will have need to change the path of this family, we will
change in the .env file. it will update the path in the entire project. bcz it is custome variable.

# insurance/utils.py
in this file we will define all the function to get the output data.
1. first i write the function to get the data from the mongodb

# insurance/config.py

this is configuration file. in which we will configre our all object.
for e.g to use the mongodb database.we will have to configure our mongoclient.
so mongoclient configuration will be define in this file. then we can esily use the 
mongoclient from anywhere in the project.
1. config the mongoclient 

# insurance_logs
 in this directory we will store all the logs file. to trace the execution of our project.
 
 # dotenv libraries
 it is used for to load the custome variable form the .env file.

 # dataclasses libraries
 it is just like class decorator. which provide some facility to our class.
 it has some additional functionality. if we will use this class decorator. then we dont need
 specify any constructur because it will initialized internally constructur and other many
 more things. we can directly define the instance variable. just only specify the variable name and datatype.
