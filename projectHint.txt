2. create the project structure by the template.py file script

#SETUP.PY
1 -e .   <-- this will indicate setup.py file. and "-e" means editable mode and "." means current working directory.
2. find_packages()   <-- this will fetch all the package from your project.
		in which "__init__py" file is existed. which will be considered as a package of this project.
3.pip install -r requirements.txt   <-- to install all dependency, and when you will install dependencies.

#logger

1. importing method of logger file is different because it is written in __init__.py file.

1. writt a static function to get clear cut idea of error.
2. call the function inside the constructur.

# _pycache_/__init__.cpython-310.pvc

both files are cache files which will be created by defualt. when we will import some code from
the someone file. then it will create by defualt this _pycache_ file.
so don,t confuse this file. it is unwanted file. which will create by default by the system.
and it will  contain metadata of the file
